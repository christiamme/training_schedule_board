# Training Schedule Board

Interface for training sessions registered in a shared Google Sheet. The sessions are scheduled in different cities by multiple training managers.

## Getting Started

The interface arranges training sessions getting the information from a shared Google Sheet. This Google Sheet needs to be published, which will allow for a script to pull the information in JSON format.

### Pre-requisites

1. The Google Sheet intended has the following titles. If you need new titles, you will have to change the fields in the `JSON_pulling` file.
